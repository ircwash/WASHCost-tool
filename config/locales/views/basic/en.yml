The total recurrent costs to maintain a continuous service include: <br/>Operating and minor maintenance expenditure: typically regular expenditure such as labour, fuel, chemicals, materials, and purchases of any bulk water. See: http://akvopedia.org/wiki/Operational_and_Minor_Maintenance_Expenditure_(OpEx) <br/>Capital maintenance expenditure: Asset renewal and replacement cost occasional and ‘lumpy’ costs that seek to restore the functionality of a system or facility, such as replacing a latrine slab or a diesel generator in motorised systems.
