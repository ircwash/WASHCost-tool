The different costs include: <br/>Operating and minor maintenance expenditure: typically regular expenditure such as cleaning materials and labour. See: http://akvopedia.org/wiki/Operational_and_Minor_Maintenance_Expenditure_(OpEx) <br/>Capital maintenance expenditure: Asset renewal and replacement cost occasional and ‘lumpy’ costs that seek to restore the functionality of a system or facility, such as replacing a latrine slab, emptying the pit, or repairing the roof of a superstrucutre. See: http://akvopedia.org/wiki/Capital_Maintenance_Expenditure_(CapManEx) <br/>Expediture of direct support: Direct support is structured support to decentralised service authorities or local governments, service providers and users or user groups related to the organisation and the management of a WASH service. The costs cover local planning, monitoring, technical advice and administrative, organisational or legal support after construction. The direct support includes capacity building for local governments to adhere to national norms, standards and guidelines. See: http://akvopedia.org/wiki/Expenditure_Direct_Support_(ExpDS) <br/>Expenditure of indirect support: Indirect support costs cover expenditure on the macro-level support, including planning and policy making.
