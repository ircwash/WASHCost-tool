The costs cover local planning, monitoring, technical advice and administrative, organisational or legal support after construction. The direct support includes capacity building for local governments to adhere to national norms, standards and guidelines. See: http://akvopedia.org/wiki/Expenditure_Direct_Support_(ExpDS) <br/>Expenditure of indirect support: Indirect support costs cover expenditure on the macro-level support, including planning and policy making.
