They cover monitoring, technical advice and administrative, organisational or legal support.  The costs of support before and during the capital construction of a project are not included; they are considered to be capital software. Direct support is often used synonymously with “post-construction support”.<br/> See: <a href=\"http://akvopedia.org/wiki/Expenditure_Direct_Support_(ExpDS)\" target=\"_blank\">http://akvopedia.org/wiki/Expenditure_Direct_Support_(ExpDS)</a><br/><br/> Expenditure of indirect support: Indirect support costs cover expenditure on this macro-level support, including planning and policy making, and support to decentralised service authorities or local government. Indirect support includes capacity building for professionals and technicians and capacity support to local government as service authorities, for example to adhere to national norms, standards and guidelines.<br/> See: <a href=\"http://akvopedia.org/wiki/Expenditure_Indirect_Support_(ExpIDS)\" target=\"_blank\">http://akvopedia.org/wiki/Expenditure_Indirect_Support_(ExpIDS)</a>"
