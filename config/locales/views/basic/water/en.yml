          info: "The white line shows the range of costs found during the WASHCost project in areas with a basic level of service. The total recurrent costs to maintain a continuous service include: <br/>Operating and minor maintenance expenditure: typically regular expenditure such as labour, fuel, chemicals, materials, and purchases of any bulk water. See: http://akvopedia.org/wiki/Operational_and_Minor_Maintenance_Expenditure_(OpEx) <br/>Capital maintenance expenditure: Asset renewal and replacement cost occasional and ‘lumpy’ costs that seek to restore the functionality of a system or facility, such as replacing a latrine slab or a diesel generator in motorised systems. See: http://akvopedia.org/wiki/Capital_Maintenance_Expenditure_(CapManEx) <br/>Expediture on direct support: Direct support is structured support to decentralised service authorities or local governments, service providers and users or user groups related to the organisation and the management of a WASH service. The costs cover local planning, monitoring, technical advice and administrative, organisational or legal support after construction. The direct support includes capacity building for local governments to adhere to national norms, standards and guidelines.See: http://akvopedia.org/wiki/Expenditure_Direct_Support_(ExpDS) <br/>Expenditure on indirect support: Indirect support costs cover expenditure on the macro-level support, including planning and policy making.

            Borehole handpump: Reticulated supply with pumping, storage and distribution through public stand posts with provision for house connections.
            Mechanised borehole: Water is supplied through a small distribution network and connected public stand posts. Water storage is limited, typically to an overhead storage tank  directly connected to the pump. Household connections are rare.
            Single town scheme: Reticulated supply with pumping, storage and distribution to a single town through public stand posts with provision for house connections.
            Multi town scheme: Reticulated supply with pumping, storage and distribution supplied to a number of interconnected towns or villages. Each village with its own storage and distribution network.
            Mixed pipe supply: Water is supplied through a combination of separate, often overlapping, service delivery systems.
        population:
          default_question: How many people in this area are receiving this water service?
          #20140221 - Changed the text of the question below
          question: "How many people are served by a %{technology} in the entire area?"
          info: Please indicate the total number of people that are meant to be using the service in the area. A water system will typically have a design population, sometimes defined by local regulations, for how many people it is meant to serve. The total number of people would be the design population of the system times the number of systems in the area. For example, if a handpump is meant to serve 300 people and there are 100 handpumps in the area, the number of people that are meant to be using the service is 30,000 people (300 people x 100 handpumps).

            between_thirty_and_sixty: Between 30 and 60
            more_thank_sixty: More than 60
           #added info
          info: The time it takes to collect water for a household is an important aspect of water services. A high level of service, such as a tap in the household, reduces the time and effort to taken to access water.

            less_than_five_litres: Less than 5 litres per person per day

            more_than_sixy_litres: More than 60 litres per person per day
          #added info
          info: The absolute minimum for drinking, cooking and basic hygiene in emergency situations is 5 litres per capita per day. A minimum of 20 litres per day is generally required for basic needs. A higher standard gives scope for some productive use of water. At 60 litres, it is assumed that users enjoy more options for water use.

          question: How reliable is the water service?
          options:
            #changed options
            works_all_the_time: Works all the time
            not_working_less_than_twelve_days_a_year: Working most days, less than 12 days a year without service
            not_working_more_than_twelve_days_a_year: Not working 12 or more days a year
            not_working_all_of_the_time: Not working all of the time
            #add info
          info: A very reliable service is one where people are secure in the knowledge that they can access water that meets all the other indicators from a given source at a given time. Reliability is also measured by the punctuality of a service. Even a service that punctually provides water every three days could be considered reliable. A service that is based on using different sources during wetter and drier periods of the year can also be considered a reliable overall service. Problematic services are characterised by down time, significant breakdowns, and slow repairs.
