The start up costs include expenditure related to hardware and software as described below:  <br/>Capital Expenditure (hardware): Capital invested in constructing or purchasing fixed assets such as concrete structures, pumps and pipes. <br/>Capital Expenditure (software): The costs of one-off work with stakeholders prior to construction or implementation, extension, enhancement and augmentation (including costs of one-off capacity building activities). <br/>See: http://akvopedia.org/wiki/Capital_Expenditure_(CapEx)"

          info: "The white line shows the range of costs found during the WASHCost project in areas with a basic level of service. The total recurrent costs to maintain a continuous service include: <br/>Operating and minor maintenance expenditure: typically regular expenditure such as labour, fuel, chemicals, materials, and purchases of any bulk water. See: http://akvopedia.org/wiki/Operational_and_Minor_Maintenance_Expenditure_(OpEx) <br/>Capital maintenance expenditure: Asset renewal and replacement cost occasional and ‘lumpy’ costs that seek to restore the functionality of a system or facility, such as replacing a latrine slab or a diesel generator in motorised systems. See: http://akvopedia.org/wiki/Capital_Maintenance_Expenditure_(CapManEx) <br/>Expediture on direct support: Direct support is structured support to decentralised service authorities or local governments, service providers and users or user groups related to the organisation and the management of a WASH service. The costs cover local planning, monitoring, technical advice and administrative, organisational or legal support after construction. The direct support includes capacity building for local governments to adhere to national norms, standards and guidelines.See: http://akvopedia.org/wiki/Expenditure_Direct_Support_(ExpDS) <br/>Expenditure on indirect support: Indirect support costs cover expenditure on the macro-level support, including planning and policy making.

          #20140221 - Changed the text of the question below
          question: "How many people are served by a %{technology} in the entire area?"
          info: "Please indicate the total number of people that are meant to be using the service in the area. A water system will typically have a design population, sometimes defined by local regulations, for how many people it is meant to serve. The total number of people would be the design population of the system times the number of systems in the area. For example, if a handpump is meant to serve 300 people and there are 100 handpumps in the area, the number of people that are meant to be using the service is 30,000 people (300 people x 100 handpumps)."

Reliability is also measured by the punctuality of a service. Even a service that punctually provides water every three days could be considered reliable. A service that is based on using different sources during wetter and drier periods of the year can also be considered a reliable overall service. Problematic services are characterised by down time, significant breakdowns, and slow repairs."
